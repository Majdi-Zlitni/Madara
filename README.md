# Madara

A way for people to manage their tasks.

## Process and Goal

Madara was designed in Figma.

I focused heavily on Testing, UX and Accessibility.

The past 3 months was a deep dive into Accessibility, so throughout the process I continously improved and redesigned the project.

My favorite part with this project, aside from the Accessibility stuff I've learned, was implementing the Drag and Drop feature.

My main inspiration for this project was Github Project.

I'm really happy right now to have finally finished it, sometimes it felt like it was never gonna be finished due to the amount of accessibility improvements you can make.

## Installation

After cloning the project, you need to run `yarn`.

This project uses 7 environment variables, which you can retrieve after creating a project Firebase.
<br>
Create a `.env.development.local` file in the root folder.
<br>
The environment variables it should have:
<br>
`REACT_APP_API_KEY`
<br>
`REACT_APP_API_APP_ID`
<br>
`REACT_APP_API_AUTH_DOMAIN`
<br>
`REACT_APP_API_PROJECT_ID`
<br>
`REACT_APP_API_STORAGE_BUCKET`
<br>
`REACT_APP_API_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
<br>
`REACT_APP_API_MEASUREMENT_ID`
<br>
